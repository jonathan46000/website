The site has been revamped and a new script included in scripts.  The layout is new and there is some new functionality to some of the pages.  Also if
you happen to be a poor soul reading this page you should check out the latest build or ReactOS v0.4.

This entry will contain some recent reviews of some software I have tried out and some notes on updates that have been made
since the last entry.<BR><BR>
UPDATES: Since the last time I posted on here the domain www.jonathan46000.com has been purchased and the site updated
accordingly.<BR><BR>
GENTOO REVIEW:  I recently installed Gentoo linux on a vm to see what it was like to do a Gentoo install.  I found it somewhat similar
to installing Arch.  I do have one major issue with Genttoo and that is that portage/emerge is absolutely aweful and contains none of 
the
well thought out dependency resolution and installation options that pacman offers.  Not considering its painful package managing syst
em 
though I would say that Gentoo is as well put together as any other stripped down targeted distro that I have used and to some degree 
better.
You do end up with a more trimmed down taylored distro than you do with Arch but not by much.  I don\'t think I could use this as my da
ily driver
without more work on the package management side.<BR><BR>
PLASMA5 REVIEW:  Most people who know me well know that KDE has been my desktop environment of choice for many years now.  I don\'t eve
n want to 
go into all of the things I hate about gnome right now and XFCE just doesn\'t provide me the full featured rich environment that I desi
re.
Needless to say I don\'t do my computing on sluggish hardware.  The transition to Plasma 5 as much less painful than the upgrade to KDE
4 was.
Everything worked great and the only hurdle was they are not co-installable so there is that hold your breath moment
where you have to uninstall you DE and hope that the one you are about to install will function when you reboot.  Everything not only 
worked
as expected it worked better.  Plasma 5 is remarkably stable and much faster than KDE4.  It has a very modern and functional feel and 
the
convenient functionality that has been added makes it a pleasurable experience to use.

This is my first entry in my blog and notes section.  Some things here will be general notes for me to reference
from time to time and those may also disappear as I need or don\'t need them.  Other items will be my general blog
and rants(Of those I have many, I assure you).  As of recent I have been trying to learn in depth the world of networking
and system administration.  Also I have been trying to learn more about Windows as Unix based/like operating systems such as 
BSD, MACOSX and Linux have been my primary computing platform for some time and though I don\'t plan to use windows for personal
reason I feel I should have fair knowledge of it none the less.  A lot of the information I post here may be geared toward
these goals or may go off in some wild other direction all together.  Do not expect me to post everyday or even every month.
Realistically this is my page for my use so if anyone else is here reading it I emplore you to manage your expectations.
