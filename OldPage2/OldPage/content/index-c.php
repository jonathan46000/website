	       Welcome to jonathan46000.com.  This is my homepage and is dedicated to my projects and ongoing self education.  This page will grow and improve along with my
enthusiasm for technology and computers.  From time to time I will post interesting scripts.  All scripts and tutorials on this page are open source and are licensed under
some version of the GPL(See individual scripts for details).  Most of my prior experience is not in web so if you are here looking for web development materials I recommend
that you manage your expectations.  You will find my blog in the "Notes" section along with random notes for myself but may be used by the general public.  I will also
eventually post tutorials and a method of contacting me.  I hope you have enjoyed my page thank you for visiting.<BR><BR>
Come Again Soon!
