I built this for work so that I could load torque wrenches on our torque transducers
for calibration.  If you turn the handel it moves the loader back and forth on the track.
It has been tested up to 1000ft-lbs.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

IDWT CORRECTION SOFTWARE<BR><BR>

This project was also done for work.  In case you can\'t tell I work at a calibration lab.
I often have to use pressure balances at work in order to calibrate pressure instruments.                                             
These are often also called industrial deadweight testers or IDWTs.  There are several physics                                        
corrections that have to be made in order to get an accurate reading and lower your uncertainties                                     
on these devices.  Early in my time at the lab I decided to learn C so that I could write software                                    
to do this for me.  Later it was re-written in C++ with the Qt Frameworks and again in C# in visual                                   
studio.  The C# version also runs in MONO on linux.  The image above is a small snippet of very old                                   
source code. <BR><BR><BR><BR>

I\'m an avid artist and love to draw comic hero art.  It has been a while since I spent a substantial
amount of time doing this but the above image is a small snippet of what I can do.  If you are interested
in seeing any of my other works contact me via email.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

Though this compositor did not end up in the final version of this project the graphics you see here 
are being rendered through a graphics display compositor and image rendering functions that I wrote 
for this board.  If you are interested I still have the code and may in the future post it under
scripts.<BR><BR><BR><BR>

This project is going to be a persistence of vision volumetric display. This is a joint venture with my 
buddy paul  If you are interested in what we are aiming for look up visio volumetric on youtube. 
We don\'t intend to sell it or anything we just want to see if we can build one.  We plan to make ours
higher resolution and color.  We\'d like to aim for between 2 and 4K colors.
