                        For the longest time I was into drawing comic art and I still do from time to time however it isn't my favorite type of art anymore.  When I was into comic art though I spent a lot of time working on it, and came up with all kinds of interesting characters.  I never named any of them or gave them stories.  I was more interested in the image, and the feeling it gave me.

                        At a certain point I got into penciling things that conveyed strong feelings either emotional or abstract representations of real world problems.  I actually drew this piece while experiencing one of the worst headaches of my life.  It was too bad of a headache to sleep so I decided to beat up some paper.

                        I've always been interested in what things are going to be like in the near future.  I try to imagine what I am going to see in my lifetime and try to draw it.  I also like to do the same thing with my projects.  I like to visualize them.  Even on my own website sometimes I'll draw the kind of page I'm looking for before I actually code it.  It gives me a standard to work against.

                        Like any good nerd I can't help but think about space and the far distant future.  These images do invoke long stories that I occasionally write.  I try to imaging what humans or our robot overlords will be doing in 300 to 1000 years and bring it to life on paper.  My house is filled with these kinds of drawings.

                        I emphasize GIMP in the title of this because open source software is very important to me and so I try to use it as much as possible for all of my projects.  Don't get me wrong I know how to use Adobe Photoshop but I also don't have a hard time replicating the same results in GIMP.  This is an image I edited to modernize the original series start trek bridge in a way I though would be appropriate.

                        Some things are easy to notice.  I changed much of the color scheme to get rid of the bright 60's colors.  I also updated the console put realistic images on the screens in the background.  I like to do editing in GIMP like this from time to time.  I also made this page's black wood grained background in GIMP.
