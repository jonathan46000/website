                    The site has been completely rebuilt. This time there is no code brought in from anywhere else.  It is all boiler plate code and much more responsive.  There is much more content in the projects sections as well.  The projects each have thier own pages with much more detailed explanations of what they are about and what is goin on in them.  Some of my friends seem disappointed that I didn't go with the new "flat" design but it really isn't my style, and it's not what I wanted on my home page.

                    The site has been revamped and a new script included in scripts. The layout is new and there is some new functionality to some of the pages. Also if you happen to be a poor soul reading this page you should check out the latest build or ReactOS v0.4.

                    This entry will contain some recent reviews of some software I have tried out and some notes on updates that have been made since the last entry.<BR><BR>

                    UPDATES: Since the last time I posted on here the domain www.jonathan46000.com has been purchased and the site updated accordingly.<BR><BR>

                    GENTOO REVIEW: I recently installed Gentoo linux on a vm to see what it was like to do a Gentoo install. I found it somewhat similar to installing Arch. I do have one major issue with Genttoo and that is that portage/emerge is absolutely aweful and contains none of the well thought out dependency resolution and installation options that pacman offers. Not considering its painful package managing syst em though I would say that Gentoo is as well put together as any other stripped down targeted distro that I have used and to some degree better. You do end up with a more trimmed down taylored distro than you do with Arch but not by much. I don't think I could use this as my da ily driver without more work on the package management side.<BR><BR>

                    PLASMA5 REVIEW: Most people who know me well know that KDE has been my desktop environment of choice for many years now. I don't eve n want to go into all of the things I hate about gnome right now and XFCE just doesn't provide me the full featured rich environment that I desi re. Needless to say I don't do my computing on sluggish hardware. The transition to Plasma 5 as much less painful than the upgrade to KDE 4 was. Everything worked great and the only hurdle was they are not co-installable so there is that hold your breath moment where you have to uninstall you DE and hope that the one you are about to install will function when you reboot. Everything not only worked as expected it worked better. Plasma 5 is remarkably stable and much faster than KDE4. It has a very modern and functional feel and the convenient functionality that has been added makes it a pleasurable experience to use.

                    This is my first entry in my blog and notes section. Some things here will be general notes for me to reference from time to time and those may also disappear as I need or don't need them. Other items will be my general blog and rants(Of those I have many, I assure you). As of recent I have been trying to learn in depth the world of networking and system administration. Also I have been trying to learn more about Windows as Unix based/like operating systems such as BSD, MACOSX and Linux have been my primary computing platform for some time and though I don't plan to use windows for personal reason I feel I should have fair knowledge of it none the less. A lot of the information I post here may be geared toward these goals or may go off in some wild other direction all together. Do not expect me to post everyday or even every month. Realistically this is my page for my use so if anyone else is here reading it I emplore you to manage your expectations.
