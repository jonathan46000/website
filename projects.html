                        This is an HTML Canvas, Star Trek inspired fan game that I wrote a couple of months ago as part of learning how to use HTML canvases to build small graphical applications.  I decided as part of the project that I wouldn't use any frameworks so that I could get a deeper understanding of the JavaScript used to build the game.  This project can also be found under scripts along with a drawing app that I wrote as a precursor to this project.

                        I worked in a calibration lab for a while and we came across a great opportunity which also presented an interesting problem.  We came across a nice Mountz torque calibration system for a good price, but we didn't have a torque loader to apply a repeatable force to the transducers.  We looked all over the internet for one and the prices were astronomical(upwards of $15,000).  This was a small company and every little bit mattered.  The solution was that I decided to design one of our own.

                        This project started as trying to make my job more convenient.  I needed an application to do some physics corrections for me so that using the Industrial Dead Weight Testers(IDWTs) wasn't an olympic math event everytime I wanted to do a pressure calibration.  What started out as a software suite for deadweight testers eventually became a full on laboratory software suite that they still use to this day.  It went through several iterations starting in C, moving to C++ with Qt and finally now in C# with .NET.

                        This project is still in progress.  Essentially what we have now is a functional RGB LED control board.  My buddy Paul and myself have been working on this persistence of vision volumetric display.  My time stays split between this and the badge project that we(HackRVA) work on for RVASec every year.

                        This was my first Scan Line Compositor. Though it wasn't used in the final project for this badge it isn't very dissimilar from the one that was.  I had a lot of fun learning to work with very low level graphics and learning how to build a compositing graphics display framework for this badge project.  We build these badges for RVASec at HackRVA every year, and I am one of the developers on the project.  We are now using a chip with enough RAM for a framebuffer so this isn't really necesarry anymore.

                        I don't work on art as much as I used to but I do have a lot of material that I have worked on.  More often than not these days though I use art as a tool for my engineering projects.  It is much faster to draw a design of anything mechanical/wooden you intend to build than it is to cad it out as long as percision or machine tools aren't required.
